# This script attempts to build an application bundle for macOS, resolving

# This originally came from Inkscape; Inkscape's configure script has an
# "--enable-osxapp", which causes some of Inkscape's installation data
# files to have macOS-ish paths under Contents/Resources of the bundle
# or under /Library/Application Support.  We don't have such an option;
# we just put them in "bin", "etc", "lib", and "share" directories
# under Contents/Resources, rather than in the "bin", "etc", "lib",
# and "share" directories under the installation directory.

OPTIONS
	-h,--help
		Display this help message.
	-b,--bundle
		The application bundle name. Default is Wireshark.app.
	-s
		Strip the libraries and executables from debugging symbols.
	-l,--libraries
		Specify the path to the libraries the application depends
		on (typically /sw or /opt/local). By default it is
		/usr/local.

	# --force will forcibly re-sign all code in a bundle."
