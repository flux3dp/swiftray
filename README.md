# Swiftray

Swiftray is a free and open-sourced software for grbl-based laser cutters and engravers. 

**Features**

- Layer controls - cut and engrave simultaneously
- Divide by color - efficient workflows for third party design software
- Hack as you like - you can modify all codes to match you self-built lasers
- Blazing performance - written in C++
- Low memory usage - even runnable on embedded system
- Cross-platform - compiles on Windows and MacOS

## Dependencies

- Compilers must support C++17 standards.
- Qt Framework 6.7.2
- Qt Framework and Creator can be installed via [online installer](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)
- OpenCV 4
- Boost 1.8
- Potrace
- libxml2
- libiconv (Windows)
- icu4c (MacOS)
- poppler
- glib
- cairo

## Setup
### 1. Clone the repo and checkout submodules
```
git clone https://github.com/flux3dp/swiftray.git
cd swiftray
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Build sentry-native

#### macOS
```
cd third_party/sentry-native
cmake -B build -S . \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DSENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad \
  -DSENTRY_INTEGRATION_QT=YES \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<PATH_TO_QT>/lib/cmake
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo --parallel
cmake --install build --prefix install
```
#### Windows
```
# The process can be skipped since the sentry-native can be installed via vcpkg
```

See discussions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/21888)

### 3. Build libpotrace from source and handle it with Conan (for Windows)
in msys2
install the following packages first
```
pacman -S base-devel
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-autotools
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-conan
```
then
```
$ cd third_party/libpotrace
$ curl https://potrace.sourceforge.net/download/1.16/potrace-1.16.tar.gz -o potrace-1.16.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf potrace-1.16.tar.gz
$ conan install . --build=missing
$ conan build .
$ conan create . user/testing
```

## Building

### macOS
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j12
```

### Windows
1. Install [vcpkg, the dependency manager](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html)
2. Build using Visual Studio by automatically loading the CMake project
3. For local development, set env QML2_IMPORT_PATH to `/path/to/qml/dlls`

## Deployment

### macOS
We can use built-in tool `macdeployqt` to deploy the app bundle generated by QMake. 
./macdeployqt <absolute path>/Swiftray.app -qmldir=<absolute path>/src/windows/qml -dmg

However, the tool is not working well with CMake. We can use the following command to deploy the app bundle.
```
cmake --build .. --target swiftrayapp_bundle -j8
```
### Windows
```
$ <Qt_Installed_Dir>/6.7.2/msvc2019_64/bin/windeployqt.exe --qmldir src/windows/qml --compiler-runtime build/bin/Swiftray.exe
```

## Coding Guides

1. Use Modern C++ as possible as you can.
2. Reduce logic implementation in widgets and QML codes, to maintain low coupling with Qt Framework.
